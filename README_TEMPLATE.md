# PKGNAME

## Nix setup
Setup with [my fork of `template-haskell`](https://github.com/dragospe/template-haskell/blob/master/wizard.sh)

Style guide is similar to that of the [MLabs styleguide](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/styleguide).

## Dev Environment

Use `nix develop`. Additionally, install `direnv-nix` for much fast dev shells.

Use `make` to see what commands are available and how they should be run.

Pre-commit hooks are enforced. Use `git commit --no-verify` as an escape hatch.
